# Microsoft and the Box Office

## Microsoft has tasked me with determining the best options to bring movies to the market.

#### We will look at key questions posed by the business and stakeholders.
##### - What should be our driving factors?
##### - What recipe or recipes will give us success?
##### - Who should we hire to direct our films?
##### - What genres should we make?
##### - What time of year should we release the movies?


## Below is a brief summation of the analysis I performed to answer these questions.

###### The information below was taken from several sources, and used to corroborate my findings.
###### Sources - IMDB.com (https://www.imdb.com/) - A comprehensive list of movies, containing information such as titles, cast, crew, and genre.
######                -Box Office Mojo (https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) - A list of movies containing foreign and domestic gross, and release dates.
######                - The Numbers  (https://www.the-numbers.com/) - Another list of movies containing movie gross, but also containing budget information.


##### I first made sense of the Box Office Mojo information.  Then I cleaned and assembled the information from The Numbers, and checked to see if the movie grosses were close, and to verify that the top movies in one chart were the top movies in another.  I found a few differences, but overall the same movies were in the top of the lists in each of the data sets.  I then created one data set out of the many IMDB datasets.  Then I merged the IMDB data set with the data set from The Numbers, and created a master set with which I could answer the posed questions.  My findings are these:
